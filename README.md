# composer-developer-cookbook

This is a repo that contains helpful utilities, getting started samples, and scripts for when working with Hyperledger Composer.
Target audience here is for developers.

*QUICK START* - change to the quick-start directory, and use the `ISSUE_THESE_COMMANDS.sh` to get a local setup going quickly. Use the `CLEANUP.sh` script to, unsurprisingly cleanup. This quick start installs all Composer cli and dev playground locally in that directo

*What do I need?* 

- Clone this repo
- If you don't want to install or have already node.js, docker etc. a quick way of getting a suitable VM setup for devleopmnet is using VirutalBox and Vagrant
