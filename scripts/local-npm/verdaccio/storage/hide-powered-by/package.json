	"readme": "Hide X-Powered-By\n=================\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/helmetjs/hide-powered-by.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helmetjs/hide-powered-by)\n[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)\n\nSimple middleware to remove the `X-Powered-By` HTTP header if it's set.\n\nHackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node if they see that your site is powered by Express (or whichever framework you use). For example, `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every HTTP request coming from Express, by default. This won't provide much security benefit ([as discussed here](https://github.com/strongloop/express/pull/2813#issuecomment-159270428)), but might help a tiny bit. It will also improve performance by reducing the number of bytes sent.\n\n```javascript\nvar hidePoweredBy = require('hide-powered-by')\napp.use(hidePoweredBy())\n```\n\nYou can also explicitly set the header to something else, if you want. This could throw people off:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }))\n```\n\nNote: if you're using Express, you don't need this middleware and can just do this:\n\n```javascript\napp.disable('x-powered-by')\n```\n"
